       "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""

The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.<br/><br/>On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.<br/><br/>We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.<br/><br/>Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.<br/><br/>Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.<br/><br/>The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.<br/><br/>So what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking.<br/><br/>But it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either.</div>\n",

The weak parts of the movie are the contrivances that link these segments together, along with unbelievably bad dialog. (Maybe someone will be brave enough to register the contrivances formally as \"goofs\" here on IMDb?)<br/><br/>No way could astronauts from the shuttle ever reach the International Space Station, but Gravity asks us to believe both this could happen and that an astronaut could then go on to reach a Chinese space station, too. These objects just don't orbit anywhere--ANYWHERE!!!!--near close enough to each other to make these events even remotely possible. Not only are their orbits vastly different in altitude and trajectory, it would be highly unlikely for them all to be near each other in the same orbit. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Gravity also asks us to believe that the orbit of the space debris intersected with that of the shuttle and was synchronized with it.<br/><br/>No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a few seconds of reading the manuals. No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate the Chinese capsule just by poking around.<br/><br/>Of lesser failures: Space debris traveling 20,000 miles an hour relative to an observer is not going to be visible except *possibly* as an indistinct cloud that passes by so fast the \"observer\" won't know what hit them.<br/><br/>For all of the CGI effort, I had hoped the Earth would look more realistic and (naturally) beautiful.<br/><br/>In closing, the special effects were great but the weak story relied on too many absurd contrivances and the script contained no redeeming dialog (sorry, George). On balance: 7 stars.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Gravity (2013)<br/><br/>A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.<br/><br/>The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, \"Children without Men.\" And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of \"effects\" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.<br/><br/>Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.<br/><br/>The answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid \"Grey.\" No distractions here.<br/><br/>Except the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.<br/><br/>The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. <br/><br/>The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. <br/><br/>There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. <br/><br/>It's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.<br/><br/>a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film \"Aningaaq\" which is recently posted all over. Google it.</div>\n",

Clooney's character keeps telling \"Mission Control\" stories for the most part that they've heard about his life. We haven't heard them and you never do. His character is only concerned about getting a record for the longest un-tethered space walk.<br/><br/>Fifth, Bullocks character acts like a buffoon. She \"claims\" to only have had 6 months of training. Based on what she says she would have been disqualified due to her questionable mental state after (years before)her daughter dies from some play ground accident at her day care. Now I like Sandra Bullock, but this performance is not worthy of an Oscar at all.<br/><br/>Sixth, She \"magically\" makes(this is because she spent over 5 minutes breathing in pure carbon monoxide, if this had been real she'd be dead) it to the Russian Soius Space capsule. She then using pictures in books can magically use buttons in Russian capsule to make it work, though claimed she trained on the simulator for them, she still needs the books to operate these things. She then \"magically\" get an empty fueled Soius capsule over to the Chinese station. Which is identical to the Soviet but in Chinese instead (this is probably fact as China bought their space station tech from Russia)and again using picture books she gets the thing to work.<br/><br/>Seventh, Drama and suspense, WHERE, you are told that the satellite debris will be around ever 90 minutes, the astronauts set their timers for the count down so again that's NEVER a surprise not only that, it's camera shot debris coming, look at watch. NO suspense.<br/><br/>Eighth, The ending, Specialist Ryan escapes in the Chinese capsule and gets back to earth, crashes in to the water and you are left with her walking on the beach. That's it you just wasted 100 minutes for this pointless that could be done in 30 minutes.<br/><br/>NOT worth your time or money.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Truly epic in scale! Whilst 'Gravity' falls short against films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso CuarÃ³n. CuarÃ³n is one of my all-time favourite directors, and this CGI-heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director, DOP and VFX artist. The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats, this is true in every aspect, the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Just shy from winning Best Picture over '12 Years a Slave', 'Gravity' left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name, and it deserved each and every one of them. A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.<br/><br/>'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clichÃ©s. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.<br/><br/>However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.<br/><br/>With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Many others have pointed out what a stinker this film is, but no amount of criticism is truly enough. So I'm adding my own.<br/><br/>Gravity fails in two ways.<br/><br/>1. Physics. Yes, physics. If you base a film in space, and pretend to be realistic, you do need to have a grasp of high-school physics. And when major, MAJOR plot points depend on a total violation of physics, what you've got is an epic failure of a movie. I liked the realistic silence, but when George Clooney 'falls' away from Sandra Bulluck, despite there being nothing whatsoever to pull him away, I stopped caring about further events in this film.<br/><br/>2. Story. There is none. Well, very little - but what there is makes almost no sense. Sandra Bullock is in a disaster, and she miraculously escapes. She's a trained astronaut who has all these weird emotional problems? She fantasizes about Clooney's ghost? She manages to figure out a control panel labeled in Chinese? Oh, please, spare me.<br/><br/>I've seen space adventure done better in B-movies of the 1950s. Above all, this film is mis-titled. It takes place in free fall, therefore 'gravity' plays no role in it! A better title would have been 'Action and Reaction.' But the writers clearly didn't understand such a deep concept. So they went with Gravity because it seemed catchy. Ugh.<br/><br/>If you want to see how this kind of space-survival story SHOULD be handled, read Andy Weir's brilliant The Martian. Let's hope Ridley Scott doesn't spoil that, in his upcoming screen adaptation. But it would be very difficult to dumb it down worse than Gravity.</div>\n",

As they work, news of a satellite collision arrives from mission control. The distant incident quickly turns into a dire emergency when a cloud of lethal debris zeroes in upon the astronauts. Mayhem ensues - and within seconds the shuttle vehicle is transformed into a destroyed and useless hulk.<br/><br/>When the dust has cleared, two space-suited astronauts find themselves alone and adrift in the immensity of space. In the real world there would be zero chance of survival - so the film is festooned with ludicrous science as it transforms itself into a juvenile comic book adventure. The cornball script confines the one-dimensional characters to lame banter and maudlin sentimentality as a series of implausible cliffhanger exploits play out against the backdrop of spectacular special effects. Despite its box-office success, 'Gravity' is just another featherweight tale from Hollywood, 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, \"In space no one can hear you scream\" Alien's \"In space no one can hear you scream\" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso CuarÃ³n's latest thriller, Gravity.<br/><br/>Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.<br/><br/>Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.<br/><br/>Alfonso CuarÃ³n is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.<br/><br/>Bullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.<br/><br/>With only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.<br/><br/>Gravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.<br/><br/>CuarÃ³n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.<br/><br/>With still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.<br/><br/>www.killerreviews.com</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso CuarÃ³n's space thriller \"Gravity\" possesses and manages to sustain in its 90 minute run time. I think I left my jaw on the theater floor. There are four things in particular to credit for this occurrence. The first of which being co-writer and director CuarÃ³n, who has constructed one of his finest outings. \"Gravity\" breathes in a way I haven't seen before and is probably one of the best technical marvels that cinema has offered in the past twenty years. CuarÃ³n handles the film with absolute certainty, restraining himself from committing any science fiction bourgeois, and reinventing the genre in a miraculous execution. <br/><br/>I've never looked at the world of Cinematography with so much respect and adoration until I saw the works of Roger Deakins and now, firmly sitting next to him at the table as the most innovative and brilliant DP working today, Emmanuel Lubezki. We've all seen what he's accomplished in his Oscar-nominated works in \"Children of Men,\" in which he was teamed up with CuarÃ³n, and Terrence Malick's \"The Tree of Life,\" both of which resulted in unimaginable losses. A 13-minute opening shot shows his abilities to capture the essence of the now, the feelings that life offers. Real life doesn't cut, CuarÃ³n and Lubezki understand this. The liberties where he chooses to take us, even when we step inside from the cold, lonely edge of space, manages to turn this very simple tale into a full-fledged meditation session with the sooth sounds of composer Steven Price. Visual effects have never been put to better use than what you will witness in \"Gravity.\" One of the few films I urge everyone to see on the biggest screen possible. The post-conversion in 3D, although cool at times, was a bit unneeded. It doesn't add to the depth and scope of CuarÃ³n's dramatic endeavor, it actually undersells it as a cheap, blockbuster space movie. An IMAX screen, the largest you can find, with a sound system able to make your eardrums bleed, those are the basic requirements. I haven't been in this much awe of a film's quality and optics this since I saw \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" when I was six years old. \"Avatar\" and \"Life of Pi\" are great spectacles, but this will be revisited in years to come as the bench mark for modern day science fiction. It's this generation's \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"<br/><br/>Finally, I've had a childhood crush on Sandra Bullock since I feasted my eyes on those pretty browns driving a bus in \"Speed\" during the early 90's. This manifested into looking at her abilities as an actor with a skewed vision. She's hinted at this greatness I've felt she could achieve in films like \"A Time to Kill,\" \"Crash,\" and her Oscar-winning role in \"The Blind Side.\" Sandra Bullock has finally realized her potential as a leading lady and taps into the very essence of the human spirit as Dr. Ryan Stone; a work that stands as her greatest endeavor and her gift to the silver screen. Natural, poised, and fully engulfed, Bullock is absolutely magnificent and in many ways, my favorite performance of the year so far. She rallies an emotional connection from the audience and demands things of herself that she hasn't done before. An Oscar-worthy work that should land her as a Best Actress nominee...and perhaps a winner.<br/><br/>George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky is exactly what you'd come to expect from the Oscar-winning producer and actor. He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale, and is a perfect balance to Bullock's frantic demeanor. As aforementioned, Steven Price's musical work is tenderly utilized and precisely executed, building up lots of affectionate tones that may leave some audience members in tears. The script by Alfonso CuarÃ³n and son Jonas CuarÃ³n inhabit a rich texture of dialogue that aren't thrown in for the sake of breaking the silence. They aren't afraid to let the scenery speak for itself or to let the actors portray their emotions in mannerisms, but when they step away from that, everything connects beautifully.<br/><br/>\"Gravity\" is a rare breed. Simplistic but so refreshingly new. Visually, it will be studied for years to come, and thematically, will be revisited by the genre's most ardent enthusiasts. One of the best films of the year. I'll say, if you haven't watched the trailers and clips, continue to do so. Too much information.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron's explosive, white-knuckle sci-fi instant classic is a wonder to behold, with devastatingly realistic effects as a backdrop to a terrifying, compelling story and terrific work by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It is both a concrete what-if story and a mesmerizing existential mindbender.<br/><br/>The U.S Space Shuttle Explorer is docked at the International Space Station. Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), on her first space mission, is installing an external device on the station that will enable astronomers to peer even deeper into space. Meanwhile, the mission commander Kowalski (Clooney), on his final mission, merrily spacewalks in a jet pack; other crew members perform maintenance or communicate with Earth.<br/><br/>Then trouble strikes. Houston reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites, hurling debris throughout Earth's orbit. Before the crew can return to the shuttle and head back to Earth, the craft and the ISS are pounded with lots and lots of pieces of metal traveling at extreme speeds. The damage is extensive, setting off an odyssey for Dr. Stone that is both literal and figurative, as she must find a way to keep going and return back home.<br/><br/>There is hardly a moment of inaction. Stone and Kowalski veer from problem to problem, everything accentuate by the simple fact that they are alone up there, not even able to contact NASA. It's a terrifying situation. Most of us might have a slight panic attack if we're stranded on the side of the road without a cell phone. Imagine being up in the heavens with no way to get down.<br/><br/>Emmanuel Lubezki's dizzying camera-work serves two purposes: it provides us with Stone's visual perspective, that of a novice, and it provides context for the disaster she and Kowalski find themselves in. If you think that the pictures from the Hubble telescope were beautiful, wait until you see these breathtaking visuals; they're as stirring and evocative as the acting and story itself.<br/><br/>Stone journey, as I mentioned, becomes more than just a path back to safety. She is grieving in her own way, becoming a quiet, almost listless passenger in life. Her decisions and her proactive attitude not only bring her closer to survival but also to a healing of her mind. This is definitely among Bullock's finest work, perhaps her greatest achievement to date.<br/><br/>I've noted before that 3D movies in darkened environments, such as outer space, are utterly needless, since 3D actually removes light from scenes. But somehow, the 3D effects in Gravity sidestep that downside. The technology is used so expertly here that whether we are approaching an object at high velocity or it is approaching us, we feel immersed in the scene, not distracted from it. Tough to do.<br/><br/>I simply cannot delve into the plot any more than I already have. The astute viewer will still have trouble guessing the outcome and the twists within the movie, particularly because the action is so hard- driven â€“ while still utterly coherent and plausible.<br/><br/>There are plenty of heart-stopping moments in Gravity, even for the most jaded of viewers. It is fantastic storytelling supported by arresting cinematography. It may be too early for movies to get serious award- season consideration, but I'll come out and say this right now: Gravity is one of the very best movies of the year.</div>\n",

Script: 0 If this had been a silent film, it would have been perfect, but, sadly, it's rife with banal and irritating chitter-chatter, none of which was used to truly propel the story nor profoundly flesh-out the characters. Everything that needed to be known could have simply been shown in a couple of captions, and expressed through body language/facial expressions. NOTHING needed to be said here, especially not this dribble that was passed off as dialogue.<br/><br/>The special effects and astounding real-ness of this film, however, blew me away! The attention to detail and the shocking realism of the actors' weightlessness is stunning! Though I warn you: anyone who is highly sensitive to motion sickness will want to avoid this film.<br/><br/>Clooney's performance may be generic (due to his weak-water scripting,) but Bullock's performance is impressive, and uncharacteristically physical.<br/><br/>There is a faint hint of \"2001: Space Oddessy\" in the scent of this film, though it clearly stands apart. The not-so-subtle metaphors for gestation, birth, re-birth, and evolution are beautifully illustrated in this film, and give the viewer an eloquent buffet of food-for-thought.<br/><br/>The ecological situation this film presents is quite serious, and not something that one might have been previously aware of... kudos to director and writer CuarÃ³n for approaching this little-known, yet globally effecting subject, which not only effects the environment but also the future of human space exploration and communications. (I recommend that you check out the accompanying documentary, which is offered as a \"special feature\" on the DVD.) Because the dialogue is so painfully stupid, next time I watch Gravity, I'll be sure to put the film on mute and enjoy its visual excellence with some ambient music, instead: voila, perfection!</div>\n",

Apart from utter trivial and bad dialogue, with no depth or feeling, we do not care one iota for them. the bullock character is so bad and useless and mostly out of control, yet we have to swallow that she makes it. the death of clooney is utterly pointless, there was no reason for him to die. the science, well the science does not exist in this movie, things happen that just would not. the debris that hits them would be falling as it rotates round the earth so would not be in the same orbit second time around, they very conveniently have the Chinese station doing that but not the other floating objects. What keeps really annoying me is that critics here that write for the so called intelligent papers and media, go in and see a film like this and leave their brains at the door, i know assume that in fact they do not possess and intellect whatsoever. they write like 14 year old fan boys, if any unknown director or someone they considered a hack had made this they would have laughed at it, but because it was cuaron they lapped it up.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don't want to rag on it, but if you're going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard's Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a \"space movie\". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clichÃ©s, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering \"eeny meeny miney mo\" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle's communication equipment fails to pick up \"Houston Control\", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock's character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clichÃ©d hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clichÃ©d announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he's drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick's Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, \"Gravity\" lacked gravitas.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">From the first trailer for the film I thought it looked intriguing, though the trailers never provided much information. You could guess at the concept and most guesses would be accurate. Its a survival/disaster story set in space with astronauts and no hint of science fiction whatsoever. I was a little surprised that suddenly the film exploded with huge ratings and huge box office returns. So because of that my expectations were high and I was prepared to potentially see a 10/10 film. I didn't hate this movie...do not get me wrong. It was entertaining and had some really nail biting moments. Visually it was good. But couldn't anyone make a visually stunning film with the backdrop of space looking down on earth. My biggest issue with the film is how unrealistic it felt. I am not a scientist and I know nothing about space travel but do I need to in order to know that NASA would not be sending up someone who is emotionally and physically unprepared and watching Bullock's character is sometimes laughable and that is unfortunate. I know I'm not the only one because other reviewers on IMDb have pointed out the exact things that bothered me. She makes poor decisions, completely unrealistic moves and generally is unbelievable in the role.<br/><br/>I don't blame Sandra Bullock as an actress because she is a great actress. In fact what I say doesn't matter because this film is raking in money and likely to get Oscar nominations (a travesty and a joke in my opinion.) Bullock's character is empty and depressing. The addition of her talking about losing her daughter is pointless and forced on you to try and get an emotional reaction and it doesn't work at all. She shows her emotions well when she is in danger but the character is weakly written and you never truly get attached to her in any way. George Clooney is mostly there as another star-power name. He does alright but once again his character does not fit the film. His sarcasm, and humour stands out and is ridiculous at times. The chemistry between him and Bullock could be great but the script does nothing to give them that opportunity. Neither one are riveting and worst of all neither of them are even remotely believable as astronauts. Clooney is supposed to be the seasoned veteran and he's training Bullock out in space...I am almost certain that she would never even remotely leave earth without being 1000% trained. As other reviewers pointed out...Bullock consults training manuals in various languages and then resorts to playing eenie meenie miney moe on a spacecraft trying to get it to fly. Are you serious? How can anyone stomach that and accept it.<br/><br/>Alfonso CuarÃ³n has apparently built a very solid fan base. Children of Men was almost brilliant and Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix was phenomenal. However, I feel like he is one of those film makers that lets stories slide in order to impress us visually or artistically. Children of Men and Gravity are shining examples of this. CuarÃ³n turns Gravity completely bizarre by forcing in absolutely ridiculous art-house scenes (Bullock's ridiculous fetal floating scene, and the end scene of her standing and being shot as though she is about to scream \"I AM WOMAN.\") What is he trying to do with this? Its irritating because this could have been a terrific disaster, survival flick and he tried to do more with it than it deserved. One of the things I loved about the film was the lack of sound in space. While it certainly reduces the impact of the shattering space stations it is more realistic and really disturbing to see all that debris and destruction but to hear nothing. As many of you who read my reviews may know, I am NOT a 3D fan. It doesn't bother me but it does nothing to increase the value of a film. I thought Gravity might be the exception to that and it wasn't. There was nothing in this film made more impressive by 3D and that's just a real shame. It sounds like I've really trashed on this movie and I have but I was just so blown away by how much everyone loves this movie and how it mostly let me down. It wasn't terrible and it was reasonably entertaining but I would never go out of my way to watch it again. It was a sub-par and rushed project that CuarÃ³n unapologetically ignores a tight script or research. You will watch this regardless and chances are you will love it because its the mass opinion right now but I have to say how I feel and this one for me was a pass. 6/10</div>\n",

The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.</div>\n",

Clooney, who while being highly space savvy is, unlike that original space larrikin, just plain annoying as he tries to emulate past heroes as he calms and guides S.Bullock through a predictable and ongoing series of high impact incidents. A handsome show off, with a serious penchant for rescuing damsels in distress, sits naturally with our George, whatever the state of his pulse.<br/><br/>But the movie is really about Bullock's character, and she is an actor capable of both great comedy and feeling (often within the same work) but here she is just not believable with the exception of the initial panic scenes that do get everyone's heart racing for a short time. In dealing with loss she has suffered on earth and in facing eternity in space, neither portrayal is credible. <br/><br/>Weaver in Aliens or Hanks in Apollo 13 - those were stories that really got to you (well, me anyway) but at the end of this its all a bit so what?<br/><br/>A very honorable exception for the cinematography, especially if you see it in the IMAX or 3D versions which really do give you a new perspective on space - but well deployed technology alone does not a movie make.<br/><br/>I give it 4 out of 10 - slightly disappointed at something that could have been so much better. I appreciate most of the world seems to disagree with my view.</div>\n",

And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing, don't-look-away-can't-look-away films I've seen for a long time. There are some films (good, entertaining films) that you just watch. Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING. Instead, you are EXPERIENCING. That's Gravity. Apart from the astonishing, beautiful and epic scale of the film, with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film. Both actors give solid, convincing performances, but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent. Her character has real depth, and (by some truly brilliant directorial techniques), you become completely empathic with her... and when a space film gets the seal of authenticity from ISS astronauts and NASA, it can't be THAT bad!</div>\n",

Much has been said about its excellent visual effects â€“ but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done â€“ and much more engagingly, if you ask me â€“ for years...take John Boorman's HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness â€“ enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney â€“ yeah right, I totally buy them as astronauts\n",
       " which goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself! <br/><br/>Thankfully, the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film's running-time, so we do not get any tear-jerking flashbacks to Bullock's tragic past on Earth; even so, her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clichÃ©d as they come! Anyway, the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon (which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so), panic attacks (contact with Base is invariably lost early on: incidentally, Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 {1995}!), floating all too easily between various space stations (most of them conveniently unworkable â€“ being peopled by corpses, boasting non-English friendly equipment, oddly self-combustible or simply meteorite targets)! As for its visually arresting 'silent' sequences of the extensive shuttle damage, again, this is no novelty (Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT!) and, in any case, it eventually wears thin with the repetition! And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney 'bailing her out' when all hope seemed lost (by the way, his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her, while he is himself headed for certain death, come off as comical more than anything else)?! <br/><br/>One might argue that I have said very little in the movie's favour to justify even its \"average\" rating: this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold â€“ with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance...!</div>\n",

       "[\"Visually, Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie. The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.So what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking.But it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either.                    628 out of 915 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?

       " 'In segments, Gravity has marvelous special effects--truly a remarkable achievement. The weak parts of the movie are the contrivances that link these segments together, along with unbelievably bad dialog. (Maybe someone will be brave enough to register the contrivances formally as \"goofs\" here on IMDb?)No way could astronauts from the shuttle ever reach the International Space Station, but Gravity asks us to believe both this could happen and that an astronaut could then go on to reach a Chinese space station, too. These objects just don\\'t orbit anywhere--ANYWHERE!!!!--near close enough to each other to make these events even remotely possible. Not only are their orbits vastly different in altitude and trajectory, it would be highly unlikely for them all to be near each other in the same orbit. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Gravity also asks us to believe that the orbit of the space debris intersected with that of the shuttle and was synchronized with it.No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a few seconds of reading the manuals. No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate the Chinese capsule just by poking around.Of lesser failures: Space debris traveling 20,000 miles an hour relative to an observer is not going to be visible except *possibly* as an indistinct cloud that passes by so fast the \"observer\" won\\'t know what hit them.For all of the CGI effort, I had hoped the Earth would look more realistic and (naturally) beautiful.In closing, the special effects were great but the weak story relied on too many absurd contrivances and the script contained no redeeming dialog (sorry, George).

       " 'Gravity (2013)A ridiculously visual movie. The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.The idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron\\'s previous major film, \"Children without Men.\" And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That\\'s a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of \"effects\" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It\\'s an achievement.Sandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she\\'s pretty amazing. You might think she doesn\\'t get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she\\'s talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.Once you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.The answer is no. And that\\'s a strength. It\\'s definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there\\'s a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid \"Grey.\" No distractions here.Except the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it\\'s also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock\\'s tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.The photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. The best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock\\'s. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it\\'s both gorgeous and taut with terror. There have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn\\'t really matter. It\\'s not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. It\\'s hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn\\'t crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn\\'t work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.a postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film \"Aningaaq\" which is recently posted all over.

       " 'First of all there is NOTHING I repeat NOTHING that warrants the cost of a 3D ticket.Second, this movie is boring and overly predictable.Third, there is nothing in this movie that makes you want to care that suddenly this \"mission specialist\" played by Bullock is stuck up in space alone.Fourth, where points could have been made to make you want to care about anyone in the movie they don\\'t bother. Clooney\\'s character keeps telling \"Mission Control\" stories for the most part that they\\'ve heard about his life. We haven\\'t heard them and you never do. His character is only concerned about getting a record for the longest un-tethered space walk.Fifth, Bullocks character acts like a buffoon. She \"claims\" to only have had 6 months of training. Based on what she says she would have been disqualified due to her questionable mental state after (years before)her daughter dies from some play ground accident at her day care. Now I like Sandra Bullock, but this performance is not worthy of an Oscar at all.Sixth, She \"magically\" makes(this is because she spent over 5 minutes breathing in pure carbon monoxide, if this had been real she\\'d be dead) it to the Russian Soius Space capsule. She then using pictures in books can magically use buttons in Russian capsule to make it work, though claimed she trained on the simulator for them, she still needs the books to operate these things. She then \"magically\" get an empty fueled Soius capsule over to the Chinese station. Which is identical to the Soviet but in Chinese instead (this is probably fact as China bought their space station tech from Russia)and again using picture books she gets the thing to work.Seventh, Drama and suspense, WHERE, you are told that the satellite debris will be around ever 90 minutes, the astronauts set their timers for the count down so again that\\'s NEVER a surprise not only that, it\\'s camera shot debris coming, look at watch. NO suspense.Eighth, The ending, Specialist Ryan escapes in the Chinese capsule and gets back to earth, crashes in to the water and you are left with her walking on the beach. That\\'s it you just wasted 100 minutes for this pointless that could be done in 30 minutes.NOT worth your time or money.                    413 out of 673 found this helpful.

       " \"Truly epic in scale! Whilst 'Gravity' falls short against films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso CuarÃ³n. CuarÃ³n is one of my all-time favourite directors, and this CGI-heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director, DOP and VFX artist. The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats, this is true in every aspect, the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Just shy from winning Best Picture over '12 Years a Slave', 'Gravity' left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name, and it deserved each and every one of them. A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect.                    215 out of 343 found this helpful.

       " \"To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clichÃ©s. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox                    18 out of 27 found this helpful.

       " 'Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick\\'s 1968 masterpiece \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn\\'t accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She\\'s terrific, don\\'t get me wrong, but I wasn\\'t as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.                    49 out of 78 found this helpful.

       " \"Many others have pointed out what a stinker this film is, but no amount of criticism is truly enough. So I'm adding my own.Gravity fails in two ways.1. Physics. Yes, physics. If you base a film in space, and pretend to be realistic, you do need to have a grasp of high-school physics. And when major, MAJOR plot points depend on a total violation of physics, what you've got is an epic failure of a movie. I liked the realistic silence, but when George Clooney 'falls' away from Sandra Bulluck, despite there being nothing whatsoever to pull him away, I stopped caring about further events in this film.2. Story. There is none. Well, very little - but what there is makes almost no sense. Sandra Bullock is in a disaster, and she miraculously escapes. She's a trained astronaut who has all these weird emotional problems? She fantasizes about Clooney's ghost? She manages to figure out a control panel labeled in Chinese? Oh, please, spare me.I've seen space adventure done better in B-movies of the 1950s. Above all, this film is mis-titled. It takes place in free fall, therefore 'gravity' plays no role in it! A better title would have been 'Action and Reaction.' But the writers clearly didn't understand such a deep concept. So they went with Gravity because it seemed catchy. Ugh.If you want to see how this kind of space-survival story SHOULD be handled, read Andy Weir's brilliant The Martian. Let's hope Ridley Scott doesn't spoil that, in his upcoming screen adaptation. But it would be very difficult to dumb it down worse than Gravity.                    24 out of 36 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?

       " \"'Gravity' begins with an extravagant visual flourish - a shuttle crew is servicing the Hubble telescope while planet Earth revolves majestically several hundred miles beneath them. As they work, news of a satellite collision arrives from mission control. The distant incident quickly turns into a dire emergency when a cloud of lethal debris zeroes in upon the astronauts. Mayhem ensues - and within seconds the shuttle vehicle is transformed into a destroyed and useless hulk.When the dust has cleared, two space-suited astronauts find themselves alone and adrift in the immensity of space. In the real world there would be zero chance of survival - so the film is festooned with ludicrous science as it transforms itself into a juvenile comic book adventure. The cornball script confines the one-dimensional characters to lame banter and maudlin sentimentality as a series of implausible cliffhanger exploits play out against the backdrop of spectacular special effects. Despite its box-office success, 'Gravity' is just another featherweight tale from Hollywood, 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.                    160 out of 294 found this helpful.

       " 'Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, \"In space no one can hear you scream\" Alien\\'s \"In space no one can hear you scream\" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso CuarÃ³n\\'s latest thriller, Gravity.Starring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.Their struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.Alfonso CuarÃ³n is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.Bullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn\\'t amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.With only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.Gravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar\\'s in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.CuarÃ³n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character\\'s success in each new attempt at survival.With still a few months left in the year, it\\'s too early to call a film the year\\'s best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year\\'s conclusion. It\\'s that breathtaking. It\\'s that good.www.killerreviews.com                    339 out of 672 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?

       " 'There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso CuarÃ³n\\'s space thriller \"Gravity\" possesses and manages to sustain in its 90 minute run time. I think I left my jaw on the theater floor. There are four things in particular to credit for this occurrence. The first of which being co-writer and director CuarÃ³n, who has constructed one of his finest outings. \"Gravity\" breathes in a way I haven\\'t seen before and is probably one of the best technical marvels that cinema has offered in the past twenty years. CuarÃ³n handles the film with absolute certainty, restraining himself from committing any science fiction bourgeois, and reinventing the genre in a miraculous execution. I\\'ve never looked at the world of Cinematography with so much respect and adoration until I saw the works of Roger Deakins and now, firmly sitting next to him at the table as the most innovative and brilliant DP working today, Emmanuel Lubezki. We\\'ve all seen what he\\'s accomplished in his Oscar-nominated works in \"Children of Men,\" in which he was teamed up with CuarÃ³n, and Terrence Malick\\'s \"The Tree of Life,\" both of which resulted in unimaginable losses. A 13-minute opening shot shows his abilities to capture the essence of the now, the feelings that life offers. Real life doesn\\'t cut, CuarÃ³n and Lubezki understand this. The liberties where he chooses to take us, even when we step inside from the cold, lonely edge of space, manages to turn this very simple tale into a full-fledged meditation session with the sooth sounds of composer Steven Price. Visual effects have never been put to better use than what you will witness in \"Gravity.\" One of the few films I urge everyone to see on the biggest screen possible. The post-conversion in 3D, although cool at times, was a bit unneeded. It doesn\\'t add to the depth and scope of CuarÃ³n\\'s dramatic endeavor, it actually undersells it as a cheap, blockbuster space movie. An IMAX screen, the largest you can find, with a sound system able to make your eardrums bleed, those are the basic requirements. I haven\\'t been in this much awe of a film\\'s quality and optics this since I saw \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" when I was six years old. \"Avatar\" and \"Life of Pi\" are great spectacles, but this will be revisited in years to come as the bench mark for modern day science fiction. It\\'s this generation\\'s \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"Finally, I\\'ve had a childhood crush on Sandra Bullock since I feasted my eyes on those pretty browns driving a bus in \"Speed\" during the early 90\\'s. This manifested into looking at her abilities as an actor with a skewed vision. She\\'s hinted at this greatness I\\'ve felt she could achieve in films like \"A Time to Kill,\" \"Crash,\" and her Oscar-winning role in \"The Blind Side.\" Sandra Bullock has finally realized her potential as a leading lady and taps into the very essence of the human spirit as Dr. Ryan Stone; a work that stands as her greatest endeavor and her gift to the silver screen. Natural, poised, and fully engulfed, Bullock is absolutely magnificent and in many ways, my favorite performance of the year so far. She rallies an emotional connection from the audience and demands things of herself that she hasn\\'t done before. An Oscar-worthy work that should land her as a Best Actress nominee...and perhaps a winner.George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky is exactly what you\\'d come to expect from the Oscar-winning producer and actor. He utilizes his wit and charm to be a lighter force of our dark tale, and is a perfect balance to Bullock\\'s frantic demeanor. As aforementioned, Steven Price\\'s musical work is tenderly utilized and precisely executed, building up lots of affectionate tones that may leave some audience members in tears. The script by Alfonso CuarÃ³n and son Jonas CuarÃ³n inhabit a rich texture of dialogue that aren\\'t thrown in for the sake of breaking the silence. They aren\\'t afraid to let the scenery speak for itself or to let the actors portray their emotions in mannerisms, but when they step away from that, everything connects beautifully.\"Gravity\" is a rare breed. Simplistic but so refreshingly new. Visually, it will be studied for years to come, and thematically, will be revisited by the genre\\'s most ardent enthusiasts. One of the best films of the year. I\\'ll say, if you haven\\'t watched the trailers and clips, continue to do so. Too much information.                    487 out of 970 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.

       " \"Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron's explosive, white-knuckle sci-fi instant classic is a wonder to behold, with devastatingly realistic effects as a backdrop to a terrifying, compelling story and terrific work by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. It is both a concrete what-if story and a mesmerizing existential mindbender.The U.S Space Shuttle Explorer is docked at the International Space Station. Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), on her first space mission, is installing an external device on the station that will enable astronomers to peer even deeper into space. Meanwhile, the mission commander Kowalski (Clooney), on his final mission, merrily spacewalks in a jet pack; other crew members perform maintenance or communicate with Earth.Then trouble strikes. Houston reports that the Russians have blown up one of their own satellites, hurling debris throughout Earth's orbit. Before the crew can return to the shuttle and head back to Earth, the craft and the ISS are pounded with lots and lots of pieces of metal traveling at extreme speeds. The damage is extensive, setting off an odyssey for Dr. Stone that is both literal and figurative, as she must find a way to keep going and return back home.There is hardly a moment of inaction. Stone and Kowalski veer from problem to problem, everything accentuate by the simple fact that they are alone up there, not even able to contact NASA. It's a terrifying situation. Most of us might have a slight panic attack if we're stranded on the side of the road without a cell phone. Imagine being up in the heavens with no way to get down.Emmanuel Lubezki's dizzying camera-work serves two purposes: it provides us with Stone's visual perspective, that of a novice, and it provides context for the disaster she and Kowalski find themselves in. If you think that the pictures from the Hubble telescope were beautiful, wait until you see these breathtaking visuals; they're as stirring and evocative as the acting and story itself.Stone journey, as I mentioned, becomes more than just a path back to safety. She is grieving in her own way, becoming a quiet, almost listless passenger in life. Her decisions and her proactive attitude not only bring her closer to survival but also to a healing of her mind. This is definitely among Bullock's finest work, perhaps her greatest achievement to date.I've noted before that 3D movies in darkened environments, such as outer space, are utterly needless, since 3D actually removes light from scenes. But somehow, the 3D effects in Gravity sidestep that downside. The technology is used so expertly here that whether we are approaching an object at high velocity or it is approaching us, we feel immersed in the scene, not distracted from it. Tough to do.I simply cannot delve into the plot any more than I already have. The astute viewer will still have trouble guessing the outcome and the twists within the movie, particularly because the action is so hard- driven â€“ while still utterly coherent and plausible.There are plenty of heart-stopping moments in Gravity, even for the most jaded of viewers. It is fantastic storytelling supported by arresting cinematography. It may be too early for movies to get serious award- season consideration, but I'll come out and say this right now: Gravity is one of the very best movies of the year.                    157 out of 312 found this helpful.

Everything that needed to be known could have simply been shown in a couple of captions, and expressed through body language/facial expressions. NOTHING needed to be said here, especially not this dribble that was passed off as dialogue.The special effects and astounding real-ness of this film, however, blew me away! The attention to detail and the shocking realism of the actors\\' weightlessness is stunning! Though I warn you: anyone who is highly sensitive to motion sickness will want to avoid this film.Clooney\\'s performance may be generic (due to his weak-water scripting,) but Bullock\\'s performance is impressive, and uncharacteristically physical.There is a faint hint of \"2001: Space Oddessy\" in the scent of this film, though it clearly stands apart. The not-so-subtle metaphors for gestation, birth, re-birth, and evolution are beautifully illustrated in this film, and give the viewer an eloquent buffet of food-for-thought.The ecological situation this film presents is quite serious, and not something that one might have been previously aware of... kudos to director and writer CuarÃ³n for approaching this little-known, yet globally effecting subject, which not only effects the environment but also the future of human space exploration and communications. (I recommend that you check out the accompanying documentary, which is offered as a \"special feature\" on the DVD.)

Apart from utter trivial and bad dialogue, with no depth or feeling, we do not care one iota for them. the bullock character is so bad and useless and mostly out of control, yet we have to swallow that she makes it. the death of clooney is utterly pointless, there was no reason for him to die. the science, well the science does not exist in this movie, things happen that just would not. the debris that hits them would be falling as it rotates round the earth so would not be in the same orbit second time around, they very conveniently have the Chinese station doing that but not the other floating objects. What keeps really annoying me is that critics here that write for the so called intelligent papers and media, go in and see a film like this and leave their brains at the door, i know assume that in fact they do not possess and intellect whatsoever. they write like 14 year old fan boys, if any unknown director or someone they considered a hack had made this they would have laughed at it, but because it was cuaron they lapped it up.                    26 out of 42 found this helpful.

       " 'Did those who\\'ve written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don\\'t want to rag on it, but if you\\'re going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard\\'s Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a \"space movie\". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clichÃ©s, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock\\'s character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering \"eeny meeny miney mo\" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle\\'s communication equipment fails to pick up \"Houston Control\", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock\\'s character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney\\'s character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clichÃ©d hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clichÃ©d announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he\\'s drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick\\'s Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, \"Gravity\" lacked gravitas.                    1,703 out of 2,656 found this helpful.

       " 'From the first trailer for the film I thought it looked intriguing, though the trailers never provided much information. You could guess at the concept and most guesses would be accurate. Its a survival/disaster story set in space with astronauts and no hint of science fiction whatsoever. I was a little surprised that suddenly the film exploded with huge ratings and huge box office returns. So because of that my expectations were high and I was prepared to potentially see a 10/10 film. I didn\\'t hate this movie...do not get me wrong. It was entertaining and had some really nail biting moments. Visually it was good. But couldn\\'t anyone make a visually stunning film with the backdrop of space looking down on earth. My biggest issue with the film is how unrealistic it felt. I am not a scientist and I know nothing about space travel but do I need to in order to know that NASA would not be sending up someone who is emotionally and physically unprepared and watching Bullock\\'s character is sometimes laughable and that is unfortunate. I know I\\'m not the only one because other reviewers on IMDb have pointed out the exact things that bothered me. She makes poor decisions, completely unrealistic moves and generally is unbelievable in the role.I don\\'t blame Sandra Bullock as an actress because she is a great actress. In fact what I say doesn\\'t matter because this film is raking in money and likely to get Oscar nominations (a travesty and a joke in my opinion.) Bullock\\'s character is empty and depressing. The addition of her talking about losing her daughter is pointless and forced on you to try and get an emotional reaction and it doesn\\'t work at all. She shows her emotions well when she is in danger but the character is weakly written and you never truly get attached to her in any way. George Clooney is mostly there as another star-power name. He does alright but once again his character does not fit the film. His sarcasm, and humour stands out and is ridiculous at times. The chemistry between him and Bullock could be great but the script does nothing to give them that opportunity. Neither one are riveting and worst of all neither of them are even remotely believable as astronauts. Clooney is supposed to be the seasoned veteran and he\\'s training Bullock out in space...I am almost certain that she would never even remotely leave earth without being 1000% trained. As other reviewers pointed out...Bullock consults training manuals in various languages and then resorts to playing eenie meenie miney moe on a spacecraft trying to get it to fly. Are you serious? How can anyone stomach that and accept it.Alfonso CuarÃ³n has apparently built a very solid fan base. Children of Men was almost brilliant and Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix was phenomenal. However, I feel like he is one of those film makers that lets stories slide in order to impress us visually or artistically. Children of Men and Gravity are shining examples of this. CuarÃ³n turns Gravity completely bizarre by forcing in absolutely ridiculous art-house scenes (Bullock\\'s ridiculous fetal floating scene, and the end scene of her standing and being shot as though she is about to scream \"I AM WOMAN.\") What is he trying to do with this? Its irritating because this could have been a terrific disaster, survival flick and he tried to do more with it than it deserved. One of the things I loved about the film was the lack of sound in space. While it certainly reduces the impact of the shattering space stations it is more realistic and really disturbing to see all that debris and destruction but to hear nothing. As many of you who read my reviews may know, I am NOT a 3D fan. It doesn\\'t bother me but it does nothing to increase the value of a film. I thought Gravity might be the exception to that and it wasn\\'t. There was nothing in this film made more impressive by 3D and that\\'s just a real shame. It sounds like I\\'ve really trashed on this movie and I have but I was just so blown away by how much everyone loves this movie and how it mostly let me down. It wasn\\'t terrible and it was reasonably entertaining but I would never go out of my way to watch it again. It was a sub-par and rushed project that CuarÃ³n unapologetically ignores a tight script or research. You will watch this regardless and chances are you will love it because its the mass opinion right now but I have to say how I feel and this one for me was a pass. 6/10                    21 out of 36 found this helpful.

       " \"Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.                    17 out of 27 found this helpful.

       " 'No wonder I detested science courses in school. Just like this film, they were boring.Sandra Bullock did an over the top performance as an astronaut caught up in space with colleague George Clooney. Bullock \"kvetched\" her way to this Oscar nod and I\\'m glad she didn\\'t win. Her constant moaning, though caught up in a precarious situation, became annoying. Clooney was also annoying with his charm and his stories. As you would expect, the special effects were quite good but not enough to sustain the film.After such a harrowing experience,we deserved more than walking away.                    18 out of 31 found this helpful.

       " \"The box office takings and the almost universal acclaim from the critics for this movie - see eg http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/gravity-m100091079 would suggest that this is a must see - well here is a contrary view.This may be from an age perspective (I was at school watching TV when that Armstrong guy sang 'I was walking on the moon one day' in July 1969) - and for the first 20 minutes we have a similar light hearted banter from G. Clooney, who while being highly space savvy is, unlike that original space larrikin, just plain annoying as he tries to emulate past heroes as he calms and guides S.Bullock through a predictable and ongoing series of high impact incidents. A handsome show off, with a serious penchant for rescuing damsels in distress, sits naturally with our George, whatever the state of his pulse.But the movie is really about Bullock's character, and she is an actor capable of both great comedy and feeling (often within the same work) but here she is just not believable with the exception of the initial panic scenes that do get everyone's heart racing for a short time. In dealing with loss she has suffered on earth and in facing eternity in space, neither portrayal is credible. Weaver in Aliens or Hanks in Apollo 13 - those were stories that really got to you (well, me anyway) but at the end of this its all a bit so what?A very honorable exception for the cinematography, especially if you see it in the IMAX or 3D versions which really do give you a new perspective on space - but well deployed technology alone does not a movie make.I give it 4 out of 10 - slightly disappointed at something that could have been so much better. I appreciate most of the world seems to disagree with my view.                    299 out of 470 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?

       " \"Two astronauts floating in space - how could that possibly be a concept for one of the most riveting films I have ever seen, and be deserving of the adjectives mentioned in this review's title? And yet Gravity is without doubt one of the most absorbing, don't-look-away-can't-look-away films I've seen for a long time. There are some films (good, entertaining films) that you just watch. Then there are those rare films which have the power to draw you in and make you forget you are WATCHING. Instead, you are EXPERIENCING. That's Gravity. Apart from the astonishing, beautiful and epic scale of the film, with directorial and photographic moments reminiscent of David Lean and Stanley Kubrick, the original script will keep you guessing all the way to the final frame of film. Both actors give solid, convincing performances, but Sandra Bullock has finally been given a part capable of revealing her real talent. Her character has real depth, and (by some truly brilliant directorial techniques), you become completely empathic with her... and when a space film gets the seal of authenticity from ISS astronauts and NASA, it can't be THAT bad!                    358 out of 686 found this helpful.

       " 'I really cannot understand the gushing reviews this has been getting and the accolades being constantly bestowed upon it: there is really nothing outstanding, or even new, about it â€“ period! Much has been said about its excellent visual effects â€“ but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done â€“ and much more engagingly, if you ask me â€“ for years...take John Boorman\\'s HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness â€“ enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney â€“ yeah right, I totally buy them as astronauts\\x85which goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself! Thankfully, the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film\\'s running-time, so we do not get any tear-jerking flashbacks to Bullock\\'s tragic past on Earth; even so, her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clichÃ©d as they come! Anyway, the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon (which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so), panic attacks (contact with Base is invariably lost early on: incidentally, Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 {1995}!), floating all too easily between various space stations (most of them conveniently unworkable â€“ being peopled by corpses, boasting non-English friendly equipment, oddly self-combustible or simply meteorite targets)! As for its visually arresting \\'silent\\' sequences of the extensive shuttle damage, again, this is no novelty (Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT!) and, in any case, it eventually wears thin with the repetition! And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney \\'bailing her out\\' when all hope seemed lost (by the way, his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her, while he is himself headed for certain death, come off as comical more than anything else)?! One might argue that I have said very little in the movie\\'s favour to justify even its \"average\" rating: this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold â€“ with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance...!                    16 out of 28 found this helpful.

    "s = \"Visually, Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before and arguably it has one of the best uses of 3D in a movie. The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.Then the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.Also at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.The the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.So what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking.But it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either.                    628 out of 915 found this helpful.                                                    Was this review helpful?
